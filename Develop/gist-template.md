## Regex Components

### Anchors
For regex expressions used to match an email, the anchors used are '^', 
which means that the  beginning and ending of the string. Since 'multiline' isn't enabled, this regex
ends at '$'
### Quantifiers
Quantifiers include the '+' sign, which connects the users email name along with the users email service name, also using the '.com' in said regex. '{a-z/d/-}' are other quantifiers that say that the 'whole alphabet' is able to be used and also that all 'digits' can be used and 'hyphons' can be used as well.
